CHANGELOG sorngen

25-06-26:
Bugfix:
1/ adapted the changes for reciprocal function (see previous entry) to not only consider 1/<op0> but also <op0>**-1 or <op0>**(-1)

25-06-25:
Bugfixes:
1/ fixed issue with division by open/closed zero for single input reciprocal function (design_SORNHDL.py lines 281-283 and 303-314)
2/ fixed issue with interval boundaries for single input reciprocal function (design_SORNHDL.py lines 327-330)

25-06-19:
Bugfixes:
1/ #01 SOLVED: removed duplicated names in the toplevel by comparison of existing names in the portlevel list to the actual from the varlist (see design_HDL.py, line 156)
2/ #02 SOLVED: changes deepcopy for HDL instance generation to copy command to reduce the memory allocation effort (see type_HDL.py, line 39) 

25-05-14:

Minor Changes:
1/ Changed the example path in ./playground and added a new entry to the readme to copy the contents from ./playground/example to ./playground before running it (otherwise changes in ./playground/example will not be covered by the .gitignore because the files were created before the gitignore)

2/ inlcuded fraction package in .stable/designflow/design_SORN.py and .stable/designflow/design_SORNHDL.py to allow fractions in SORN datatype definition

3/ added rounding functions in .stable/designflow/design_SORN.py section 2.6.1/ and .stable/designflow/design_SORNHDL.py to avoid wrong rounding resulting from unsufficient precision in DT generation and LUT entry calculation

4/ fixed an issue with open/closed zero interval bounds when using datatypes without negatives in .stable/designflow/design_SORN.py section 3/

5/ fixed an issue with division by zero resulting in NaN only when zero is an inlcuded interval bound, and in inf if the divisor has an open zero interval. In .stable/designflow/design_SORNHDL.py

24-09-16:

Additions:
1/ the tool now provides a GUI (App.py)

Major Changes:
1/ the tool is now organised as a python tool. All imports are now relative to the projects root (stable)
2/ the output directory can now be specified after the specification file (e.g. 'python3 -m specification.sorn ../')

Minor Changes:
1/ some python conventions have been enforced at some places (e.g. file formatting) to ensure readability
2/ the designflow steps are now defined as centralized functions
3/ the tool may now use custom environment variables to work properly ('standalone' and 'specification')
4/ the class 'stable.control.ctrl_env.sorn_env' now stores its values as explicit instance variables (uses '__init__()' instead of class constants)
5/ add simple 'versioning', it is not automated however
