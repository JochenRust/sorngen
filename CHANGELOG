CHANGELOG sorngen

25-05-14:

Minor Changes:
1/ Changed the example path in ./playground and added a new entry to the readme to copy the contents from ./playground/example to ./playground before running it (otherwise changes in ./playground/example will not be covered by the .gitignore because the files were created before the gitignore)

24-09-16:

Additions:
1/ the tool now provides a GUI (App.py)

Major Changes:
1/ the tool is now organised as a python tool. All imports are now relative to the projects root (stable)
2/ the output directory can now be specified after the specification file (e.g. 'python3 -m specification.sorn ../')

Minor Changes:
1/ some python conventions have been enforced at some places (e.g. file formatting) to ensure readability
2/ the designflow steps are now defined as centralized functions
3/ the tool may now use custom environment variables to work properly ('standalone' and 'specification')
4/ the class 'stable.control.ctrl_env.sorn_env' now stores its values as explicit instance variables (uses '__init__()' instead of class constants)
5/ add simple 'versioning', it is not automated however
