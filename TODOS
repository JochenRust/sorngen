1/ implementation of "text-based" functions with more than one input like "hypot(x,y)". Currently only sinlge-input functions like "sqrt(x)" are implemented

2/ Conversion Functions:
For every design run add the generation of a SORN vhdl package which inlcudes the datatype, SORN width, etc. The package can be used with generic FxD2SORN and SORN2FxD vhdl modules which are also to be added to the repo. Alternatively generate datatype-specific conversion functions in every design run. Both versions could also be selectable as an optional parameter in the specification file / GUI
Edit/Remark: how to handle different versions of fxd-package in VHDL? Might have to be implemented w/o fxd types.

3/ Testbenches:
For every generated design add a testbench for the toplevel design. How should stimuli be inlcuded? (random, exhaustive, ...)

4/ High-Level/Software reference model in C/Python/...

5/ Quantisierung der Intervallgrenze in Python einstellbar.
